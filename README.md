### Introduction

Various feature selection algorithms, including Lasso, Sure Independence Screening (SIS), Streamwise (SR), False Discovery Rate (FDR), and our proposed DDC.

We use both simulation and real data from Facebook to validate our proposed algorithm DDC, with comparison to all above baselines regarding effectiveness and efficiency.

data folder:
  data/simulation
  data/real
  
real folder:
  all implemented algorithms on the real data (small-scale and large-scale)
  
  
simulation folder:
  all implemented algorithms on the simuated data (100 datasets for two different scales: n=100, p=5500 and n=1000, p=170000)
