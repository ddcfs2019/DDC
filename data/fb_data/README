Use the following commands to generate required files for feature selection procedures. All are based on Python 3.

uid_pid.txt
Each line: uid, pid, label(positive -1/negative -0 user)

fid_brandname_cateogory.txt
Each line: facebook brand id, facebook brand name, facebook brand category


1. # generate a large dataset in a format of traditional machine learning.
Each line is: user_id,features,label

python convert_raw_to_features.py > large_features.txt


2. # generate a small dataset small_features.txt with randomly selected 50% of features and 20% of samples.

python random_select_small_dataset.py > small_features.txt


3. # convert feature-based files into hierarchical representation for FDR and DDC.

python gen_hierarchy_features.py large_features.txt > large.txt
python gen_hierarchy_features.py small_features.txt > small.txt


large_features.txt and small_features.txt will be considered as inputs for Lasso, SIS, and SR algorithms, while large.txt and
small.txt will be sent to FDR and DDC.
